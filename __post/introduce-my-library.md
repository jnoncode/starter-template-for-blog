## Key Features of DecodeDeps

- **Support for Multiple File Types**: DecodeDeps can analyze JavaScript (JS), JSX, TypeScript (TS), and TSX files, creating a comprehensive visualization of dependencies. By scanning import and require statements, it builds a detailed graph that provides an intuitive overview of module relationships.
- **Multi-Folder Analysis**: Easily analyze dependencies across entire projects or focus on specific subfolders. DecodeDeps simplifies complex projects by allowing users to narrow down or expand the scope of analysis, providing flexibility for both detailed and high-level views.
- **Circular Dependency Detection**: Circular dependencies can lead to difficult-to-diagnose errors and performance issues. DecodeDeps automatically detects and highlights these circular references, helping developers address them early in the development process.
- **Customizable Node Colors**: Nodes are color-coded based on module size, offering an at-a-glance visual cue of each moduleâ€™s relative weight. This feature aids developers in quickly identifying larger modules that may benefit from optimization.
- **Interactive Graph Visualization**: DecodeDeps features an interactive graph where users can zoom, pan, and explore dependency relationships. Adjustable node sizes and link distances further enhance the visualization, allowing users to customize the display according to their needs.
